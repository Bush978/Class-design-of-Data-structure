# Class-design-of-Data-structure
## This repository is the class's design of Data structure using C++ programming language. 
- Knowing that many students from Beijing Forestry University are difficult to cope this work, our members upload relevant codes of it. Camparing with other projects, our guys prefer to focus on the Accepted ansewer judged by Touge planform rather than basic knowledge.
- We will update the codes in the future constantly until the end of the semester. Hope you can get some feedbacks from it and report the bugs to us. We are looking forward to your participation and construcive suggestions. Your encouragement is our momentum.  

**Beliving that you can definitely enjoy the process of learning Data structure and algorithm.**
